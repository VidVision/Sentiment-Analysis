       "  {'text': \"I had disembarked a long international flight and my plans had changed so, I needed a hotel quickly. I chose this hotel, because I have stayed in Crowne Plaza in a number of cities such as Sydney, Adelaide, Singapore and Tokyo. I have always found Crowne Plaza an excellent chain. This hotel did not live up to the Crowne Plaza name, the best I can call it is something approaching a Motel 8. It did have a decent location if you want to be within walking distance to the sightseeing places such as JFK memorial and the tower. However, on the minus side, it is right in the centre of downtown and the surrounding areas can look a little dodgy if you walk in certain directions at night. My concern was mostly by a few homeless people around but fortunately I never had a problem during my stay.\\n.\\nThis hotel is undergoing renovations in the lobby, restaurant and bar area. I was assured that there would not be any trouble with noise from the construction.\\n\\nMy room was 1012. The room was a decent size with a comfortable bed. The room looked like it was refurbished by Motel 8 though, comfortable but very basic. I found it odd that there was no safety deposit box in the room and the iron in the room had seen better days along with the world's smallest ironing board. A new iron and a decent sized ironing board would have been appriecated.. The first morning I was woken up by drilling from the room above me. It’s nice that you are renovating, but unfortunately, the renovations did not extend to the bathroom in my room. The bathroom hada tiny shower/bath and a toilet, that was it. The bathroom sink was outside of the bathroom and there was nowhere to hang your towels or to put any items. Very weird, and NOT up to the standards I would expect from the Crowne Plaza chain.\\n\\nThe only redeeming quality of this hotel was the initial customer service and comfortable bed. Advertising was misleading to say the least. I was disappointed in this hotel. I was expecting some form of luxury, however instead I got a Motel 8 type of accommodation. There is nothing wrong with Motel 8 because you know what to expect, but I didn’t expect this from a Crowne Plaza. IHG needs to pull the Crowne Plaza brand from this hotel.\",\n",
